# Full-Stack Developer @ Jackson & Frank Assessment: Employee Onboarding Portal
Project Overview:

This assessment focuses on developing a simplified Employee Onboarding Portal to streamline the onboarding process for HR managers and new hires. The portal should provide basic employee management functionalities and allow HR to track the progress of onboarding tasks. 
The project has been scoped down to focus on core features only, which should take approximately 5-7 hours to complete.

# Core Requirements (Must-Have Features):
User Registration & Login:
- Implement a simple user registration and login system using username and password.
- No need for 2FA or Social Login.
  
Employee Management (CRUD Operations):
- HR Managers should be able to:
    - Create new employee profiles.
    - Read/View a list of all employees.
    - Update existing employee information.
    - Delete employee profiles if required.
  
- Employee profiles should include the following fields:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Department
    - Role
    - Onboarding Status (e.g., In Progress, Completed).

Onboarding Task Tracker (Mock-Up Implementation)
- HR Managers should be able to view a list of tasks assigned to each employee.
- Employees should see a dashboard view with their assigned tasks and a checkbox or button to "Mark as Complete".
- Implement mock task status changes on the front-end only (no backend updates are needed).
- Include a task progress bar or percentage representation to show task completion status visually.
  
Employee Dashboard
- Separate view for employees to see their onboarding progress, task completion status, and any pending items.
  
Responsive Design
- Create a simple dashboard view for employees to see their assigned tasks and onboarding progress.
- Separate HR Manager View that allows them to view and manage all employees and their onboarding statuses.

Responsive Design
- Ensure the front-end UI is responsive and adjusts well across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

# Optional Bonus Features (Only if you have extra time to dedicate to the project. NOT mandatory):
These are not mandatory and should only be considered if you have additional time after completing the core requirements:

Email Notification System
- Send automated emails to employees when a new task is assigned or when deadlines are approaching.

Document Management
- Implement a document upload system where employees can submit required documents (e.g., ID Proof).

Real-Time Updates
- Use WebSockets to update task completion status in real-time.

Employee Profile Page
- Add a detailed profile page for each employee showing onboarding activities.

Dark Mode Toggle
- Implement a dark mode toggle for theme switching.



# Deliverables
- GitHub Repository: Share the complete source code in a public GitHub repository.
  - Ensure separate folders for client (front-end) and server (back-end).

- README File:
    - Include setup instructions, the tech stack used, and a brief description of the features.
    - List any known issues or limitations.

- Documentation (Optional):
  - Include additional documentation for API endpoints, database schema, and user flow diagrams if applicable.

- Deployed Version (Optional):
  - If possible, deploy the project on a cloud service like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel and share the live link.

# Submission Guidelines
- Create a GitHub repository with a clear folder structure for client and server.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via the application form or email it to the provided contact.
- Ensure the README file includes setup and run instructions.
- Submission Deadline: Complete and submit the project within 5 days of receiving the brief. If you need more time, please inform us via hr@jacksonandfrank.com.
- Expected Time Commitment: 5-7 hours for core features. You are welcome to spend more time on optional features, but this is not required.
